Week 04 - Home exercise 5: Temperature conversion program

Solution proposal.

The temperature converter, written a third time: four functions, and neither
kind of bad input can stop it any more.

# 1. Ask for the scale.
#
# This is the re-prompt loop we already had. The check is a membership test, so
# nothing is converted and no exception can arise - which is exactly why this
# one worked before try / except existed.
#
# .strip() removes stray spaces and .upper() accepts a lowercase answer, so
# "  c  " is treated as "C".

# 2. Ask for the temperature.
#
# This is the one that could not be written before. .isdigit() rejects -40 and
# 98.6, which are both perfectly good temperatures, so there was no way to
# check this input without also refusing half the valid answers.
#
# float does the check by doing the conversion. The return is inside the try
# and inside the while, so it only happens when the conversion succeeded - and
# when it does, it leaves the loop and the function together.

# 3. The arithmetic, and nothing else.
#
# This function asks nothing and prints nothing, so it can be tested without a
# keyboard: convert_temperature(100, "C") is 212.0 or it is not.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The two kinds of validation, side by side
#
# get_scale and get_temperature have the same shape and check their input in
# completely different ways, and the reason is worth being clear about.
#
#   get_scale        the set of valid answers is two strings, and we can list
#                    them. A membership test answers the question exactly, and
#                    nothing is converted, so nothing can raise.
#
#   get_temperature  the set of valid answers is every number that exists. It
#                    cannot be listed, and no string method describes it - which
#                    is what we found when .isdigit() turned out to reject -40,
#                    98.6 and " 42 ". So we stop asking about the text and try
#                    the conversion instead, and let float report the failure.
#
# The rule that falls out: when you can list the valid answers, test membership.
# When you cannot, attempt the conversion and catch the failure.
#
# Test cases that separate a right answer from a plausible one:
#
#     -40          same in both scales. If your formula is round the wrong way
#                  this is the one input that will not tell you
#     98.6 F       -> 37.0 C, body temperature. Rejected by .isdigit()
#     0 C          -> 32.0 F
#     -300 C       triggers the absolute zero warning
#     -300 F       -> -184.4 C, which is cold but perfectly possible, and must
#                  NOT trigger the warning. Checking the input rather than the
#                  Celsius value gets this one wrong
#     cold         re-prompts instead of crashing
#     Enter alone  re-prompts: "" is not a number either
#     "  c  "      accepted, thanks to .strip().upper()
#
# What this program does NOT do:
#
# - float accepts more than you might want. "1e5" is a hundred thousand
#   degrees, "inf" is infinity and "nan" is not a number at all, and all three
#   are accepted here without complaint. Rejecting them means adding a range
#   check after the conversion, not a cleverer conversion.
# - There is no upper sanity bound. 5000 degrees Celsius is accepted silently,
#   which is hotter than the surface of the sun.
# - The absolute zero check happens after the conversion has been displayed, so
#   the user sees the impossible number first and the warning second. Checking
#   before displaying would be better and would need the two branches of the
#   output to be rearranged.
# - It converts once and stops. Doing several conversions in one run means
#   wrapping main's body in another loop and asking whether the user wants to
#   go again - which is a third re-prompt loop, of the same shape as the first.
